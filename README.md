# Ambient-Temperature-Monitoring-System-Using-STM32-Nucleo-Board
Developed an Ambient Temperature Monitoring System using the STM32F303RE microcontroller on a Nucleo board. Interfaced a DHT22 temperature sensor with the microcontroller to measure real-time ambient temperature and displayed the readings on a 16×2 I2C LCD module.
